# ORCA needs the full path to its binary, so please provide the full path.

[psi4]
# As the Psi4 installation without conda is, to put it slightly, tricky it was
# decided to allow the installation of Psi4 into a separate conda environment.
# pysisyphus then creates a Psi4 input and sends it to the (bash)-script given below
# that accepts/expects one argument. It is the responsibility of the scrip to activate
# the appropriate conda environment and submit the Psi4 input. An example runpsi4.sh
# script is given below.
